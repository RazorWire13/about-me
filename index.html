    <p>
        My name is Tim, I am currently working on this site as an interactive game site to continue the story. As a developer, I
        want to keep sandboxing and learn more about algorithms and build good foundations on programming techniques, so
        that in the future I could power through coding much easier. I love sandboxing with apps and sites and want to continue
        to use this creativity to help enhance the industry by solving programming issues and creating new projects. This
        is mainly a playground and sandbox site where I test different interactions so I could understand the logic of Javascript.
